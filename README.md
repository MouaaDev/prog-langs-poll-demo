# Programming Languages Poll Demo App

A simple voting app to learn svelte basics.

The app idea from youtube channel "The Net Ninja".

In `main` branch I used props to pass data and events, go to `store` branch to see `svelte\store` approach.

## The Usage

Install dependencies via command:

```bash
pnpm install
```

To run it on your browser:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```
